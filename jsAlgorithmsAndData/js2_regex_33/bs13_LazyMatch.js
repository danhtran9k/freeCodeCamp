DESCRIPTION

Find Characters with Lazy Matching
In regular expressions, a greedy match finds the longest possible part of a string that fits the regex pattern and returns it as a match. The alternative is called a lazy match, which finds the smallest possible part of the string that satisfies the regex pattern.

You can apply the regex /t[a-z]*i/ to the string "titanic". This regex is basically a pattern that starts with t, ends with i, and has some letters in between.

Regular expressions are by default greedy, so the match would return ["titani"]. It finds the largest sub-string possible to fit the pattern.

However, you can use the ? character to change it to lazy matching. "titanic" matched against the adjusted regex of /t[a-z]*?i/ returns ["ti"].

Note: Parsing HTML with regular expressions should be avoided, but pattern matching an HTML string with regular expressions is completely fine.

Fix the regex /<.*>/ to return the HTML tag <h1> and not the text "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>". Remember the wildcard . in a regular expression matches any character.

==================================================================
TESTCASE

The result variable should be an array with <h1> in it

myRegex should use lazy matching

myRegex should not include the string h1

==================================================================
SETUP

let text = "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>";
let myRegex = /<.*>/; // Change this line
let result = text.match(myRegex);

==================================================================

*/

let text = "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>";
// normal gredy match behavior
let myRegex1 = /<.*>/;
let result1 = text.match(1);
console.log("ðŸš€ ~ file: bs13_LazyMatch.js ~ line 48 ~ result1", result1)
// lazy match
let myRegex = /<.*?>/;
let result = text.match(myRegex);
console.log(result)
