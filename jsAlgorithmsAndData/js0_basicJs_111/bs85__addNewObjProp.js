DESCRIPTION

Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a bark property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";
Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, bow-wow.

Example:

var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
Add a bark property to myDog and set it to a dog sound, such as "woof". You may use either dot or bracket notation.



==================================================================
TESTCASE

You should add the property bark to myDog.

You should not add bark to the initialization of myDog.

==================================================================
SETUP

var myDog = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};



==================================================================

*/

var myDog = {
    "name": "Happy Coder",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
  };
  
myDog.bark = "hmmm"
