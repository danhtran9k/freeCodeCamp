DESCRIPTION

Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects
Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new name after a colon when assigning the value.

Using the same object from the last example:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
You may read it as "get the value of user.name and assign it to a new variable named userName" and so on. The value of userName would be the string John Doe, and the value of userAge would be the number 34.

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables highToday and highTomorrow the values of today and tomorrow from the HIGH_TEMPERATURES object.



==================================================================
TESTCASE

You should remove the ES5 assignment syntax.

You should use destructuring to create the highToday variable.

You should use destructuring to create the highTomorrow variable.

highToday should be equal to 77 and highTomorrow should be equal to 80.

==================================================================
SETUP

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// Only change code below this line
  
  const {today, tomorrow} = HIGH_TEMPERATURES

// Only change code above this line

==================================================================

*/

const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
    yesterday: 75,
    today: 77,
    tomorrow: 80
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
    
  const { today: highToday, tomorrow: highTomorrow } = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
  // Only change code above this line

  console.log(highToday)
  console.log(highTomorrow)
